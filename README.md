## Default Login

- **Username**: professor
- **Password**: password

*Note: Change these credentials in production!*

## Usage

### For Professors:

1. Login with your credentials
2. Create classes at the beginning of the school year
3. Select a class to enter the classroom page
4. Use "Start Class" button to activate the class session
5. Monitor live statistics in the Faculty Dashboard
6. Create polls/quizzes during class
7. View gradebook and class details as needed
8. Adjust settings and preferences in real-time

### For Students:

1. Tap the screen or RFID card to wake the nameplate
2. Login using RFID card or manually enter student number
3. Register if you're a new student
4. Select an active class to join
5. Use interactive buttons (Raise Hand, Thumbs Up/Down)
6. Participate in polls/quizzes when they're started
7. Sign out when done

## Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Flask (Python)
- **Database**: SQLite (SQLAlchemy ORM)
- **Real-time Communication**: Flask-SocketIO (WebSockets)
- **Frontend**: Bootstrap 5, HTML5, JavaScript
- **Authentication**: Flask-Login

## Database Models

- Professor: User accounts for instructors
- Student: Student information and RFID card IDs
- Class: Class information and active status
- Enrollment: Student-class relationships
- Attendance: Daily attendance records
- Participation: Interaction tracking (hand raises, thumbs up/down)
- Poll: Poll/quiz questions and options
- PollResponse: Student poll responses
- ClassSettings: Per-class preferences

## RFID Integration

The app supports RFID card integration. In a production environment, you would connect an RFID reader to send card IDs to the `/api/student/login` endpoint. For testing, you can simulate RFID taps by entering card IDs manually.

## Future Enhancements

- Real RFID hardware integration
- Export gradebook to CSV/Excel
- Advanced analytics and reporting
- Mobile app versions
- Multi-language support
- Cloud deployment options
